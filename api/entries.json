While “Boomer” is a term that is used to signify a generational difference, it has become a broad term for someone older who is closed-minded and resistant to change. It can make older people feel dismissed or humiliated. \n\nMillennials and Generation Z use it to reply to any older person who says something condescending about young people – and the issues that matter to them. It is sometimes also said when an older person has said or done something that appears “out of date”. This can result in this older person feeling embarrassed and unconfident. ",

It is linked to assumptions and stereotypes about the 2SLGBTQIA+ community.  Being a part of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community does not mean you look or act a certain way. This phrase is premised on a false idea that people who are gay are recognizable, usually because of stereotypes about how gay people look, behave, and/or act. The only way to tell if someone is gay is if they tell you themselves. Suggesting there are ways to tell if someone is gay can leave someone feeling invalidated. It can cause them to question how they present themselves to the world. It also reinforces the stereotypes and society’s belief that gay people all have certain physical features, voice and tone, personality traits, etc.",

Model minority myth is where a racialized group is thought to be “better” or more successful than others due to “inherent” traits. This puts individuals and groups into competition with each other. This can add to internalized pressure or shame when a person feels they haven’t achieved this model minority status despite recognizing it’s problematic, and can serve to diminish the barriers that individuals, particularly Asian people, experience.",

It is usually considered harmful when it reduces a person to just their disability and how it can be “triumphed”. It also has the potential to make other people with disabilities feel as if they have to be extraordinary to be respected and appreciated. Inspiration porn presents disabilities as obstacles to overcome, or as only valid if the person with the disability is “exceptional”. This messaging can make people living with disabilities feel that they have to shape their lives in ways that appeal to this narrative. It is important to emphasize and celebrate the successes of people with disabilities, however it is equally important to be mindful of objectification and perpetuating narratives related to inspiration porn.",

It instead focuses on the person’s delivery, ultimately devaluing their comments. It’s often used against Black women as a way of telling them to calm down or take a lighter approach when sharing their perspectives. It’s tied to the microaggression of assuming that Black women in particular are aggressive and emotional. \n\nTone policing is also often directed to Asian women and implies that they are too quiet, not confident and/or not assertive enough. It serves to monitor the way that Asian women present themselves and reinforce stereotypes and both gendered and racial expectations of how Asian women should act, speak, and present themselves.",

        "definition": "This phrase is often attributed to stay-at-home dad’s, single dads or households with same-sex dads. \n\nIt stems from traditional cultural values and gender norms that suggest that the ideal household is a nuclear family. Within these values, it’s believed that the woman/wife should be the parent who stays home with the children and takes care of the household. When a man is seen occupying that role, he's considered “less masculine” or “more like a mom”. It perpetuates the belief that men aren’t emotional, nurturing or capable enough to raise children. It also reinforces the negative idea of “gendered duties”. This kind of labeling is rooted in toxic masculinity and doesn’t account for the diversity in roles and genders within a family unit. \n\nThis messaging also has negative implications for the career growth of women. In many cases, “gendered duties” require women to do a double duty. They have the double duty of working in the workplace while taking on the majority of the responsibility at home. When men are ridiculed for doing domestic work or taking care of children, and discouraged from engaging in these responsibilities at home, it perpetuates the double duty of women and signals that men ought to be in the workplace, advancing in their careers, and taking on leadership roles.",

This often begins even before a child is born, when friends and family begin to purchase toys and clothes in particular colours based on perceptions of what is to be played with, worn, etc. by different genders. Doing this not only limits our definition of gender but it forces kids and adults to fit into narrow molds of what is acceptable. It tells boys that it’s wrong to like pink because it makes them “more feminine”. Boys who show preference for this colour can feel embarrassed, ridiculed, or as though something is wrong with what they like. \n",

But this sends the message that showing emotion is distinctly a feminine trait. It perpetuates gender stereotypes that discourage men from showing emotion while simultaneously implying to women and society as a whole that toughness is a man's trait. \n\nThis creates harmful stereotypes and expectations of what it means to be a man. This kind of microaggression teaches boys at a young age to hide their emotions. All individuals should be encouraged to express their emotions in ways that feel natural to them, regardless of gender. Similarly, we must recognize that toughness is not synonymous with masculinity, and that people of all genders can be strong, assertive, and “tough” in their own way.",

        "definition": "Asking for someone’s “real name” is often directed at members of the 2SLGBTQ+ community who do not use their name given at birth or their name used before transitioning, particularly those who identify as non-binary or trans. It suggests that the name a person chooses to identify with is not “real”, or that the name does not match our gender perceptions. It also inappropriately inquires into one’s experience as someone who is two-spirit, trans, non-binary, and/or gender non-conforming (e.g. to gather information about a person’s identity). This also relates to the term “deadnaming” which refers to when someone who is non-binary or transgender is referred to their name before transitioning, which they do not identify with. Not every two-spirit, trans, non-binary, or gender non-conforming person will consider their birth assigned name to be a deadname, but it is important to use the name that person uses for themselves. While well-intended, framing gender pronouns as a preference suggests that it is simply a preference that does not necessarily need to be respected. It is not necessary to qualify a statement like “What are your pronouns?” with the word “preferred”.",

        "definition": "This phrase is most often said to dads of daughters. It’s saying that their daughter is so pretty that boys won’t be able to control themselves around her, and that her dad will have to be the one to protect her from them. This phrase is offensive to both boys and girls. It suggests that boys are incapable of treating girls with respect (and works in tandem with other microaggressions like “boys will be boys’). It also suggests that girls won’t be able to advocate for themselves and will need the male parent to come to her rescue. ",

Residential “schools” were places of neglect, discrimination, and abuse. They’ve caused trauma that has continued throughout generations. \n\nResidential “schools” were created to strip Indigenous Peoples of their culture and traditions. It forced them to assimilate to English, Christian culture. They were fully sponsored and supported by the Canadian government. Calling them a ‘dark chapter in Canadian history’ takes away from the intentional nature of these places at the time. Physical & sexual abuse often occurred at these “schools” for over 160 years. Many children also died.\n\nWhen society tries to suggest this is a past issue, it fails to recognize the discrimination Indigenous Peoples experience currently. It can cause a lot of pain and trauma to resurface.",

Examples include telling a person living with a disability how brave they are, or telling an individual who is transgender how resilient they are. \n\nComments like these are harmful for several reasons. First, these statements imply that one’s identity is something to be resilient of. They suggest that it is inherently difficult to have a particular identity, or that a particular identity is abnormal, and then praise an individual for their bravery and resilience in spite of their identity. Additionally, when said to individuals expressing experiences of discrimination, statements like these contribute to “toxic positivity” and sometimes implies that people may be able to overcome oppression if they are simply resilient. This statement also may compel people to explain their experience with oppression to meet a narrative that centres “resiliency” and “bravery”. \n",

It reproduces the trope and myth of “vanishing Indian” as it presents colonialism and oppression against Indigenous Peoples as a thing of the past, assuming that Indigenous Peoples and histories are not alive in the present. \nWhen said to Indigenous Peoples sharing historical atrocities (i.e genocide, residential schools, and others), it shows a lack of understanding of how these events have enduring impacts. \nThese statements gloss over the fact that many of these historical events are not well understood by all Canadians, not properly reconciled, and/or still affect subsequent generations. Further, telling Indigenous Peoples that it is “time to move on” perpetuates historical erasure and implies that colonialism and oppression are less prevalent in society and no longer current issues that need to be discussed. \nFurther, many racialized individuals, and Black people in particular, may experience these statements as a form of invalidating past traumatic, racist events, as well as current forms of racism. This perpetuates the erasure of past and present forms of racism and serves to silence racialized individuals.",

This can include bisexual, pansexual, omnisexual, polysexual, and more identities. Assuming that bi+ spectrum identities are a phase is part of the larger issue of bisexual erasure or invisibility. Bisexual erasure is when the existence and/or the legitimacy of \nbi+ spectrum identities are questioned, trivialized, or denied. This has impacts on individuals, who can feel excluded and misunderstood. Further, this type of exclusion/erasure is sometimes known as monosexism (the assumption of only being attracted to one gender) also has societal, economic, and health impacts, as it leads to a lack of resources and supports for bisexual individuals.
